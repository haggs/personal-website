In the summer of 2020, my wife Alethea and I bought a fixer-upper on Lake St. Clair, a massive lake near Detroit that's part of the Great Lakes system. Right out our back door we're able to see tons of fresh water wildlife, distant windmills in Canada, violent storms, ice formations that look like the surface of another planet. In the summertime I'm usually out pleasure boating or fishing. Here are just a few highlights that I've photographed over the recent years.
