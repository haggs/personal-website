In 2022, we took a trip to Italy. I've never eaten so well on a trip in my life, it's right up there with Japan. 
We rented a car in Rome and drove to Positano, Amalfi, Ravello, Matera, Polignano a Mare, and back to Rome.
In Polignano a Mare we met up with my good friend Brian who had been living in Italy for years.

Alethea had been to Italy before but even she was blown away by the places we went to. We hiked, we sweated, we challenged our fears, and we had a blast.
