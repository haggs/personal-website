On October 8th, 2022, on the shores of Lake St. Clair, I was wed to the beautiful Alethea Critides.
It was an intimate ceremony held in our backyard, attended by about 20 of our nearest and dearest, and officiated by my childhood friend, Tim.
After the ceremony, we had an incredible dinner in the private dining room at the [Shinola Hotel](https://www.shinolahotel.com/) in Detroit.
After some drinks and speeches there, we wrapped up the night with piano karaoke at [Sid Gold's Request Room](https://sidgolds.com/detroit/).

Our wedding was everything we had hoped it would be. These photos taken by Detroit based photographer [Ryan Southen](https://ryansouthen.com),
capture the highlights of our wedding day and the love that surrounds us.
