On October 8th, 2022, on the shores of Lake St. Clair, I was wed to the beautiful Alethea Critides.
It was an intimate ceremony held in our backyard, attended by about 20 of our friends and family, and officiated by my good friend, Tim.
After the ceremony, we had dinner in the private dining room at the [Shinola Hotel](https://www.shinolahotel.com/) in Detroit.
After some drinks and speeches there, we carried on the party with piano karaoke at [Sid Gold's Request Room](https://sidgolds.com/detroit/).

These photos taken by Detroit based photographer [Ryan Southen](https://ryansouthen.com), capture the highlights of our wedding day.
