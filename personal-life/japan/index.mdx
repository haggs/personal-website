Alethea and I took a trip to Japan in 2023. It was right before starting my new job at NVIDIA. We had always wanted to go,
and when I quit my job, Alethea said "well I guess we'll go next year". I said "why?".

Japan is incredible. Everywhere you look, there's something new (for an American) to see. I had a bucket list of all kinds of japanese food I've always wanted to try
and we managed to try it all. We visited Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo again. Each place was different from the next, and each was great in its own way.
